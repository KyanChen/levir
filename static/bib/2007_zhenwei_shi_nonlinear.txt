abstract = {This letter proposes a blind source separation (BSS) method based on the nonlinear innovation of original sources. A simple algorithm is presented by minimizing a loss function of the nonlinear innovation. The method exploits the nonstationarity of sources in the sense that the variance of each source signal can be assumed to change smoothly as a function of time. Simulations verify the efficient implementation of the proposed method, especially its robustness to the outliers.}
